# Modular-City

This project builds a modular metropolis using Processing Java. Static layouts were an option, but I went with a randomly generated approach with a rustic vibe.
The vertex coordinates of each object had to be declared in code. In order to increase performance, I implemented render distance and wrote code that determines whether a field already has a well nearby before adding one.
